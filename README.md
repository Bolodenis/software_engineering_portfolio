# Project Name: Hamburger Menu Navigation

## Overview
This project implements a **responsive hamburger menu** for navigation on smaller screens. The menu toggles visibility when the hamburger icon is clicked, and it closes when a navigation link is clicked. This ensures a clean and accessible user experience on mobile and tablet devices.

## Features
- **Hamburger Icon**: Displays a clickable icon that toggles the visibility of the navigation menu.
- **Responsive Design**: The menu adapts to different screen sizes and changes based on the width of the device (using media queries).
- **Hide Navigation on Link Click**: When a user clicks a navigation link, the menu automatically closes.
  
## How it Works
1. **Hamburger Icon**:
   - On small screen devices (width <= 768px), the hamburger icon is displayed.
   - Clicking on the hamburger icon toggles the visibility of the navigation menu.
  
2. **Navigation Links**:
   - Clicking a navigation link will close the menu and redirect the user to the appropriate section or page.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - The menu hides itself on larger screens and shows a typical horizontal navigation bar.
   - On smaller screens, the navigation is hidden initially and can be shown by clicking the hamburger icon.

## Files
- **`index.html`**: Contains the structure of the page, including the hamburger menu and navigation links.
- **`styles.css`**: Contains the styles for the page, including responsive styling for the hamburger menu.
- **`script.js`**: Contains the JavaScript code to toggle the navigation menu visibility.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.
